                    Hi, My name is David Wylie. I grew up in a military family and had the opportunity to see some of the
                    world.
                    It also started my interest in travel and food. I like cooking as much as I like eating food. I went to
                    college for hospitaliy and worked in food service for about 21 years.
                </p>
                <p class="d-flex flex-wrap">
                    As much as I liked working in restaurants. I wanted to switch to something with more consistency in my
                    regular day to day life. I've alway had an interest in technology, and thought I would try to pursue a
                    career in it. This brought me to U Penn Coding Bootcamp which will help to propel me into the next
                    Chapter
                    of my Life.
                </p>
                <p class="float-left">
                    I'm hoping that some of my skills from the restaurant industry will be able to transfer over to the tech
                    world. I have been working/managing teams for the last 15 years. I know how integral teams are in the
                    tech world. With my role as manager, I have had to hone my communication skills by all my interaction
                    with staff and guest.
                </p>
