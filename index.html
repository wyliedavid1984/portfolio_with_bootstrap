                            Hi, My name is David Wylie. I grew up in a military family and had the opportunity to see
                            some of the world.  It also started my interest in travel and food. I like cooking as much as I like eating food. I went to
                            college for hospitaliy and worked in food service for about 21 years.
                            <br />
                            As much as I liked working in restaurants. I wanted to switch to something with more
                            consistency in my regular day to day life. I've alway had an interest in technology, and thought I would try
                            to pursue a career in it. This brought me to U Penn Coding Bootcamp which will help to propel me into the next Chapter of my Life.
                            <br />
                            I'm hoping that some of my skills from the restaurant industry will be able to transfer over
                            to the tech world. I have been working/managing teams for the last 15 years. I know how integral teams
                            are in the tech world. With my role as manager, I have had to hone my communication skills by all my
                            interaction with staff and guest.
                        </p>
